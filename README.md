# To-Do List Project

This is a simple and interactive **To-Do List** application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, edit, complete, and delete tasks in an organized manner. The project focuses on keeping the interface clean and user-friendly by showing or hiding elements based on the current state of the to-do list.

## Features

- **Add a Task**: Users can add tasks to the to-do list by entering text and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Edit a Task**: Each to-do item has an edit button that allows users to modify the task's text.
- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed, moving them to a separate "Completed Todos" section.
- **Delete a Task**: Users can remove tasks from both the to-do and completed sections.
- **Dynamic Display**: The application automatically hides the "To-Do List" and "Completed Todos" sections when they are empty, providing a clean look.
